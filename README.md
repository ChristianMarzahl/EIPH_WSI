# Deep Learning-Based Quantification of PulmonaryHemosiderophages in Cytology Slides


## Installation & SetUp

Docker:
```docker
docker pull bronzidocker/eiphwsi
docker run -p 8888:8888 bronzidocker/eiphwsi
```

Afterwards, please download the whole slide images with the following notebook

### Slides

After downloading, the slides can be examined with [SlideRunner](https://github.com/DeepPathology/SlideRunner) or [EXACT](https://github.com/ChristianMarzahl/Exact). A script to upload the slides and annotations to an EXACT instance can be found in the following notebook. The annotations for SlideRunner are within the slide folders.
